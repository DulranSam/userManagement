# userManagement
Hey everyone , this is a mini user management type project which can be used to make CRUD operations. This project was created using the MERN stack for to gain experience.

1.Cross Verifications are done and ensured to avoid conflict within the system
2.Passwords are hashed using bcrypt to avoid data breach
3. Axios was used to connect the two ends of the application
4. Route handling is done and matched accordingly in the frontend 
5. The schema data criteria have been given according to what I think is the necessity for a simple user management system , the created and updated times will be provided in the cluster!
6. Mapped through the JSON array to send display the data accordingly. 
7. Appropriate use of state hooks and useEffect to auto-update on changes
8. Proper use of Javascript promises like async/await and resolve/reject using.
9.Error handling done properly using try,catch,finally blocks.
10. locally hosted and tested the endpoints (testing as of right now cuz i'm still building it)
